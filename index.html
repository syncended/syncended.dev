			<div class="description">Building orientation can sometimes take a lot of time and effort, and geolocation can't accurately display your location in the building. Because of this, this application uses special qr codes that are configured for a specific position in the building and allow you to find yourself in it. QRoad is an application that allows you to determine your location in a building using qr codes.
				<br>How does it works: 
				<br>You scan the qr code placed at the entrance to the building or in the building itself, then the app checks the points entered in it and displays your location.
